<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>It is imperative that companies collect data, that is both "relevant" and "reliable", in order to survive the stiff market competition.
Such data may then pass through a series of cleaning phases in order to carefully structure it, to organize it and to wean out all that may be unnecessary to the task at hand.
Finally using correct statistical techniques and modern analytical software, raw data can be distilled into pure information.</p>

<p>Correct information helps guide managerial decisions. It may be presented visually to partners and shareholders, in a suitable form such as bar-graphs, pie-charts, histograms,
stem-leaf plots. Data science is a rapidly growing field. It is a branch that lies sandwiched somewhere between computer science and mathematics, statistics and linear algebra in particular.
Today modern machine learning algorithms coupled with R and Python's programming libraries make data science more relevant than it has ever been.</p>

<p>We are thus obliged "by the data all around us" to expand our minds, to push our boundaries further by asking "relevant" questions and seeking answers.
Hence this website represents my own personal endeavour to learn and explore this fascinating subject.</p>
